<div class='adtitle2'>THE OVERALL BOYS IN<br />
SWITZERLAND</div>


<h2>THREE CHEERS FOR EUROPE</h2>


<p>It was the first day of summer, and it was
the last day of the ocean trip.</p>

<p>Jack and Joe, two Overall Boys, had crossed
the big Atlantic. They were now sailing into
a strange city, in a strange country, with a
strange language.</p>

<p>The city was Antwerp. The country was
Belgium, and the language was&mdash;well, almost
anything one cared to speak, French or German
or Dutch or English.</p>

<p>Jack said he should try English first. Then,
if people did not understand him, he should
use the Dutch words which the Sunbonnet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Babies had taught him. But if people did not
understand him then, he should have to keep
still, or talk with his hands.</p>

<p>"Oh! I shall not keep still," said Joe. "I
shall speak everything all at once, French and
German and Dutch and English. You just
watch me!"</p>

<p>"Ho! ho!" laughed Jack. "We <i>will</i> watch
you, and so will all the people in Antwerp.
But now watch that great houseboat. I believe
it is like the boat Molly and May's Uncle
Dirk owns. A family is living on it. They
have a canary bird and a dog and a cat and
flowers, just as they have on Uncle Dirk's boat."</p>

<p>"I should rather go to Holland than to
Switzerland," said Joe. "Let's ask the people
on that houseboat to take us up to their Water
Land."</p>

<p>"No, sir! I want to go to Switzerland,"
said Jack. "I want to see the great mountains
all covered with snowbanks and forests and
flowers. There is not a mountain in the whole
of Holland."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>"Look!" shouted Joe. "I see the first castle!
We are sailing right up beside it. I wonder if
a really, truly King and Queen are living in it."</p>

<p>"Of course," said Jack, "unless they have
been killed and their castle turned into a
prison or a museum."</p>

<p>"Do you suppose it has a dark dungeon
under it?" asked Joe. "How I should like to
see a real dungeon!"</p>

<p>"Come on, father is calling us," said Jack.
"Our boat has stopped. It is time to get off."</p>

<p>"Oh! Perhaps father will take us into that
old castle, Jack. Then we can see if it really
has a dungeon under it," cried Joe.</p>

<p>So the Overall Boys said good-by to their
friends on the ocean steamer. They said good-by
to the Captain. They said good-by to the
Cook. The Cook and the Captain were their
<i>special</i> friends and they were <i>specially</i> sorry to
leave them.</p>

<p>But the boys had something very important
in their minds.</p>

<p>When the heavy plank was pulled over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
from the dock to the steamer, the two Overall
Boys were the first to step on it. They ran
as fast as they could run down the steep plank.</p>

<p>Everybody wondered why those two boys
were running so hard. There was plenty of
time. No one needed to run. But in a second
everybody knew, for Joe was throwing his cap
high into the air and shouting, "Hurrah for
Europe! Three cheers for Antwerp!" And in
half a second more Jack was throwing his cap
high into the air and shouting three cheers for
Europe, too.</p>

<p>Yes, the Overall Boys were the first in their
party to step foot on Europe, and they were
the first to give it three cheers.</p>

<h2>ON THE RIVER RHINE</h2>


<p>The next few days were exciting ones for
the Overall Boys.</p>

<p>Joe said he knew that he was dreaming,
and his dreams were all about castles and
kings and queens and strange languages.</p>

<p>Jack had to tell him very often that he
was sailing up the beautiful river Rhine toward
Switzerland, that the castles and the kings and
the queens and the strange languages were really
true.</p>

<p>"I know that the castles are really here,"
said Joe, "for I am counting them. Look at
that great fort on the hill!"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Jack, "the Captain says if we
were their enemies, the soldiers in that fort
would not let our boat pass up the river."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, I am glad we are not their enemies,"
said Joe. "I don't like the looks of the big guns
peeping through those holes in the fort walls.
I like the old castles better."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 209px;">
<img src="images/i-011.jpg" width="209" height="271" alt="river with large rock on bank forming a cliff" />
<div class="caption"><i>A high rock above the river</i></div>
</div>

<p>And so the Overall Boys
sailed by castles and still
more castles, which were
built high on the banks
above the river. Most of
them were very old, so old
they were falling to pieces.</p>

<p>Lower down on the river
banks there were large vineyards,
where the finest grapes were growing.</p>

<p>Their father told the boys strange stories
about the people who once lived in these old
castles. He told them about a beautiful sea
maiden who used to sit on a high rock above
the river combing her long, golden hair and
singing sweet songs. He told how brave young
men sailed their boats into the dangerous
waters to listen to her songs, and were drowned.</p>

<p>Fortunately the maiden did not sing while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
the Overall Boys were passing her rock, so
they went safely on their journey.</p>

<p>A little later Jack cried, "Come, Joe, the
Captain is going to tell us a story."</p>

<p>"Is he going to tell it in some dreadful,
strange language?" asked Joe.</p>

<p>"No, sir!" said Jack. "This Captain knows
how to speak English."</p>

<p>"Hello!" called the Captain. "Do you
boys like mice? Both of you do! Well, that
is brave. I am going to tell you about a man
who did not like mice.</p>

<p>"Do you see that large, round tower just
ahead of us? It is built on a rock in the
middle of the river. It is called the <i>Mouse
Tower</i>. This is the reason why.</p>

<p>"Once upon a time&mdash;I cannot tell you just
how long ago, but once upon a time&mdash;there
lived a rich Bishop. He lived in a great castle
up there on the river bank. He had fine farms,
and he made much money. He filled many
barns with his grain, and he kept his gold in
strong boxes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 579px;">
<img src="images/i-012.jpg" width="579" height="271" alt="Caslte on bank of river" />
<div class="caption"><i>The Bishop's Mouse Tower built on a rock in the river</i></div>
</div>

<p>"A great many poor people lived near the
rich Bishop. He should have taught them how
to work and how to pray, but he did not. He
did not even give them grain when they needed
it, or gold that they might buy bread.</p>

<p>"One year when the people were very hungry,
they begged the Bishop so hard for bread
that he could not sleep. He said they were like
a pack of hungry mice.</p>

<p>"At last the Bishop told the beggars to go
to an empty barn near by, and he would soon
satisfy their wants. So the people hurried into
the barn, and waited for the Bishop to come.
He came, but he did not bring them food or gold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, no! The selfish Bishop told his servants
to set fire to the old barn, and the poor people
who were inside soon stopped crying for food.</p>

<p>"That night while the Bishop was asleep in
his castle, he dreamed a strange dream. He
dreamed that some hungry mice were eating a
fine picture of himself which hung on his bedroom
wall. He watched them until they had
torn it all to pieces.</p>

<p>"Just then a servant ran into his room and
wakened him.</p>

<p>"'O Bishop Hatto! Bishop Hatto!' cried the
servant. 'The mice are coming. They are
coming out of the hot ashes of the old barn
which we burned last night. They have followed
me up to your castle. You must run
for your life.'</p>

<p>"So the Bishop jumped on his horse and
rode down the hill as fast as he could ride,
and the mice ran after him. When he came
to the river the mice were almost upon him.</p>

<p>"The Bishop left his horse and jumped into
a small boat. He rowed very hard until he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
came to that stone tower in the middle of the
river.</p>

<p>"'Now,' said he, 'I am safely away from
those miserable mice.'</p>

<p>"But he was not safely away from them,
for the mice could swim.</p>

<p>"The Bishop shut himself into the tower
and closed the doors and windows. But the
mice could gnaw. They ran up the stone walls
and gnawed through the wooden doors. Then
they ran down the doors on the inside and
found the wicked Bishop.</p>

<p>"How the Bishop wished that he had been
kind to the poor, starving people. How he
wished that he had given them food and gold
when they needed it so much. Now it was too
late. The hungry people had sent their spirits
back in these hungry mice to punish him as he
had punished them.</p>

<p>"And so the old stone tower has been called
the <i>Mouse Tower</i>, or <i>Bishop Hatto's Tower</i>,
ever since. Now, what do you think of that
for a story?" asked the Captain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>"I tell you, I hope I never shall be such a
mean old Bishop as he was!" said Joe.</p>

<p>"And I am glad he is not living now!"
said Jack.</p>

<p>Soon the Overall Boys had sailed as far up
the beautiful river Rhine as their big boat would
take them. They had seen so many old castles,
and they had heard so many strange stories
about them, the boys felt as if they had just
passed through a really, truly Fairyland&mdash;and
perhaps they had.</p>

<h2>THE BEAR CITY</h2>


<p>"Hello, Jack! Hello, Joe!" called the boys'
father very early one morning. "Wake up!
Wake up and give the bears their breakfast."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! Where are we?" cried Joe.
"I'm so sleepy! Where are the bears? I don't
see any."</p>

<p>"I know where we are," said Jack. "We
are in the city of Bern, where the bear cave is."</p>

<p>"Good! We are in Switzerland at last,"
cried Joe, running to the window. "But where
is the snow? I thought the mountains in
Switzerland were <i>all</i> covered with snow! These
mountains are covered with green trees."</p>

<p>"These are not the <i>real</i> mountains, Joe,"
said Jack. "The great snow-covered mountains
are farther away. I guess we shall see them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
before long. I heard some one say that, on a
clear day, the view of the snow-covered Alps
from this city is one of the finest in all Switzerland,
and that the sunsets here are wonderful.
But let's have our breakfast now."</p>

<p>"All right," said Joe. "Then let's be off
to hunt for the bears. But why do the people
keep bears right in the middle of their city?"</p>

<p>"Father says it is because a bear was killed
on this spot just before the city was built,"
said Jack. "So the people named the city
Bern. They have kept a few bears in a large
pit here ever since, and that is more than four
hundred years."</p>

<p>"Do let's hurry and find their cave!"
cried Joe.</p>

<p>So the Overall Boys were soon hurrying
through the busy streets of the Bear City. In
the middle of many of the streets they saw
fine, large fountains. Above the center of some
of the fountains were the figures of famous men,
while plants and flowers were growing in others.</p>

<p>In a few of the beautiful fountains women<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
were doing their washing. They placed the
soiled clothes on boards by the edge of the
clear water. Then they soaped the clothes well,
and pounded them with flat stones, and rinsed
them up and down until they were quite clean.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 577px;">
<img src="images/i-016.jpg" width="577" height="360" alt="women carrying washing from town fountain" />
<div class="caption"><i>An odd way to do the family washing</i></div>
</div>

<p>It was certainly an odd way to do a family
washing; at least, so the Overall Boys thought.</p>

<p>There was one fountain which interested the
boys more than any of the others. Above the
center of this fountain stood the stone figure
of a strange looking man, who was holding a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
stone baby in his hands. He was about to
bite the baby's head right off. Other babies
were hanging from the ugly man's belt and
peeping from his pockets.</p>

<p>It is called the fountain of
the Child-eater, and naughty
children never like to pass very
near it. But the Overall Boys
knew that the stone Child-eater
could not hurt them, so they
laughed at the old fellow and
hurried on.</p>

<img src="images/i-017.jpg" width="196" height="387" alt="Statue of giant eating babies" />
<div class="caption"><i>The Child-eater</i></div>
</div>

<p>It was not long before the
boys were racing across a great
stone bridge leading to the
deep hole in the ground where
the bears lived. Joe reached the pit first.</p>

<p>"Hurrah! I see three of them," he cried,
leaning over the high rail above the pit. "See
that baby bear beg for something to eat! Go
to the fruit stand, Jack, and buy some carrots
to feed him. Father says bears like carrots."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 579px;">
<img src="images/i-018.jpg" width="579" height="380" alt="Bears down in pit with people looking down at them" />
<div class="caption"><i>The boys threw the carrots, one at a time, over the wall into the pit</i></div>
</div>

<p>So Jack ran to the fruit stand near by and
bought a big bunch of carrots. The boys threw
the carrots, one at a time, over the wall into
the pit, and how they shouted and laughed to
see the bears catch and eat them, just like big,
brown boys.</p>

<p>Sometimes one bear would catch more than
his share of the carrots. Then the other bears
would chase him about until they made him
climb up a tall tree in the middle of the pit.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
He did not dare to come down until his bear
friends had eaten all they wanted. If he tried
to do so, they chased him quickly back again.</p>

<p>"Look!" cried Joe. "I have found an orange
in my pocket. I am going to throw it down
to the bear that is waving his paw at me.
Watch him catch it."</p>

<p>"Watch him!" shouted Jack. "He didn't
catch it. The bear near him knocked him over
as quick as a wink, and caught the orange
himself."</p>

<p>"See, he is climbing up the tree with it!
Isn't he a selfish old bear!"</p>

<p>"Look at the bear in the little pond of
water," cried Jack. "He is playing ball with
the other bear. Now the other bear has jumped
into the pond, too. See them box each other's
ears! And see them roll over and over in
the water! Oh, I never, never saw anything so
funny!"</p>

<p>"I believe they are real boys dressed up in
bear skins," said Joe. "I never thought bears
could act so much like boys."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mother says she never thought boys could
act so much like bears," said Jack.</p>

<p>The boys watched the bears nearly all the
forenoon. Joe said he hadn't laughed so much
since his last football game in America. He
wished that he could live in Bern always, and
feed the bears every morning.</p>

<p>"I'm getting hungry myself," said Jack at
last. "Let's buy some gingerbread bears to eat.
There is a window full of them over in that
store."</p>

<p>Then away the boys ran and bought gingerbread
bears of all sizes&mdash;father bears and mother
bears and little baby bears and dancing bears
and stiff soldier bears.</p>

<p>Jack and Joe were sure they had never eaten
anything in all their lives so good as those
gingerbread bears.</p>

<p>"Come on, now!" cried Jack. "Father has
some more fun for us. He wants us to go
down the street with him to see a queer old
clock tower."</p>

<p>"I know what it is," said Joe. "He told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
us about it the other day. We can hear the
cock crow and see the bears parade, if we are
there on time."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 589px;">
<img src="images/i-019.jpg" width="589" height="435" alt="boys running through village" />
<div class="caption"><i>"Then let's run!" said Jack. So the boys raced around corners and under arches</i></div>
</div>

<p>"Then let's run!" said Jack. "It is almost
twelve o'clock now."</p>

<p>So the boys raced back over the great stone
bridge. They raced around corners and under
arches and along covered sidewalks, until they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
came to a low tower which arched right over
the sidewalk.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 571px;">
<img src="images/i-020.jpg" width="571" height="510" alt="town clock just before noon" />
<div class="caption"><i>The boys reached the tower just as the large clock near the top said five minutes before twelve</i></div>
</div>

<p>The large round clock near the top of the
tower said five minutes before twelve. On
the wall below the clock sat a queer little
bronze man holding an hourglass in his hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>At the left of the man stood a bronze cock
and at his right a bronze dragon. Suddenly the
Overall Boys saw the cock flap his wings and
wag his head and cry, "Cock-a-doodle-doo!"</p>

<p>A moment later two bronze giants up in the
top of the tower struck the great bell with their
hammers twelve times. The cock wagged his
head and flapped his wings and again crowed,
"Cock-a-doodle-doo!" Then a small clown rang
a tiny bell and a procession of bears began
marching just below the old man.</p>

<p>Some of the bears carried little guns and
swords, and one bear rode on a tiny horse.</p>

<p>When the clock in the top of the tower
stopped striking, the procession stopped marching,
and the old man turned his hourglass upside
down. The dragon wagged his head, and the
cock crowed, "Cock-a-doodle-doo!" Then all
was still. Yes, it was very still. The Overall
Boys were thinking.</p>

<p>At last Joe said, "I wish I could take that
clock back to America. I should like to show
it to the Sunbonnet Babies. I am sure they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
didn't see anything half as strange as that in
Holland."</p>

<p>"Well, they will have to come to Bern if
they want to see it," said Jack. "You can't
pack that great tower in your trunk."</p>

<p>"Father is calling us," said Joe. "He says
we shall have just time to eat dinner before
we must take the train. Where do you suppose
we are going next?"</p>

</div>




<h2>ABOVE THE CLOUDS</h2>


<p>"See it pour! And just hear the thunder!"
said Joe, looking out of the car window. "It
sounds as if giants were rolling rocks down the
mountain sides. I hope they will not hit our
train."</p>

<p>"Look! The train is stopping," said Jack.
"The conductor says we must all get out here
and take another train. How can we change
while it is pouring so hard!"</p>

<p>The rain was really pouring down so fast
that umbrellas were of no use at all. But the
Overall Boys ran to the end of the platform
and climbed into the high front seat of a queer
little car.</p>

<p>It was certainly the strangest car the boys
had ever seen. It was built so that one end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
was much higher than the other end, and people
had to go up some steps to get into it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 573px;">
<img src="images/i-024.jpg" width="573" height="456" alt="tram up the mountain" />
<div class="caption"><i>"We are climbing right up the side of a mountain"</i></div>
</div>

<p>In a few moments the little train was moving
slowly up the steep track.</p>

<p>"Where do you suppose we are going?" cried
Joe. "I believe we are climbing right up the
side of a mountain. My! How it rains! I
guess we are up among the clouds."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>"We shall soon be up above the clouds,"
said Jack. "We are climbing Mount Rigi. We
are going to stay all night on the mountain, too."</p>

<p>And so it happened. The train was soon
pulled up the steep mountain side until it was
above the rain and the wet clouds. The sun
was shining brightly up there, but the valleys
below were covered with a thick white blanket.</p>

<p>At last the sun and the wind began to carry
great pieces of the cloud blanket high into
the sky. Through the openings in the clouds,
below them the boys could see tiny villages
and blue lakes.</p>

<p>And away down below, hanging in the soft
white clouds, was a rainbow&mdash;all red and orange
and yellow and green and blue and violet.</p>

<p>"Look! We are above the rainbow bridge!"
cried Joe. "If only I could jump over on it,
I could slide right down to the earth again."</p>

<p>"Why, you are on the earth now," said Jack.</p>

<p>"Oh, so I am! But isn't it wonderful up
here!"</p>

<p>The boys watched the fluffy clouds blow far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
away, carrying the lovely rainbow with them.
And they watched the great red sun drop down
behind the snow-covered mountains in the west.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i-025.jpg" width="600" height="303" alt="boys standing on lookout" />
<div class="caption"><i>The boys watched the fluffy clouds blow far away</i></div>
</div>

<p>Suddenly Joe cried, "Those mountains are
on fire, Jack! Look! How can they burn when
they are all covered with snow?"</p>

<p>"It looks as if the red-hot sun had set the
world on fire this time, doesn't it?" cried Jack.</p>

<p>But it hadn't, though the mountains were
rosy for a long time after darkness had come
in the deep valleys below. The great round
moon climbed slowly up the sky, and millions
of stars peeped down at the boys.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>They had never been so near the stars
before. They were almost six thousand feet
nearer than they were on the ocean steamer,
and six thousand feet are more than a mile.</p>

<p>At last the boys were so tired they went
into a small hotel, high on the mountain, and
were soon tucked away in two narrow white
beds. For a few moments they lay very still,
then Joe whispered, "Jack, do you hear those
bells tinkling, out on the mountain side?"</p>

<p>And Jack whispered, "Yes, Joe. They are
cow bells. You know five thousand cows are
pastured on this mountain in the summer time."</p>

<p>"From the sound, I guess they all wear bells,
too," said Joe. "Isn't it lovely! The bells
make me so sleepy."</p>

</div>



<h2>ON MOUNT RIGI</h2>


<p>So the boys were lulled to sleep by the soft
music of the tinkling cow bells. But very early
next morning they were wakened by another
kind of music. It was the clear call of an alpine
horn at four o'clock in the morning.</p>

<p>The horn seemed to say, "Wake up! Wake
up and see the beautiful sunrise!"</p>

<p>Although Jack was still half asleep, he
shouted back, "All right! We'll be up in a
jiffy." And they were.</p>

<p>Everybody hurried out to the mountain top
to watch the great sun sail slowly up the sky.</p>

<p>"Look!" cried Joe. "Last night the sun
went down behind those mountains over there,
but now it is coming up away over here. How
did it ever get around here?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, you know, Joe!" said Jack. "The sun
always sets in the west and rises in the east."</p>

<p>"But how can it go down on one side of the
world and come up on the other?" asked Joe.</p>

<p>"Because the earth whirls around every twenty-four
hours," said Jack. "In the morning our side
of the earth is whirling toward the sun, and in
the afternoon we are whirling away from it."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! Are we whirling now?" cried
Joe. "I thought the world was standing still.
I thought it was the sun that was going
around."</p>

<p>"The sun is going around, Joe, but so are
we. Father says that our world is whirling
faster right now than the fastest automobile can
race," said Jack.</p>

<p>"My!" said Joe. "Is that what makes the
wind blow so hard up here? Hold on, or we
shall be blown off!"</p>

<p>"Just look at those cows!" shouted Jack.
"They are being milked. Let's go and watch."</p>

<p>Then away the boys raced to a group of
big, brown cows that were being milked not far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
away. Great pails full of the rich, creamy milk
were carried into a little house near by.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 567px;">
<img src="images/i-029.jpg" width="567" height="371" alt="boys having breakfast" />
<div class="caption"><i>She filled two tall mugs with warm milk and piled a plate with gingerbread cakes, and set before them</i></div>
</div>

<p>"How good it looks!" said Joe. "Let's ask
if they will sell us a drink."</p>

<p>But they did not have to ask, for the old
woman who lived in the tiny house saw the
boys coming. She knew that they had not had
any breakfast, so she filled two tall mugs with
warm milk, then she piled a plate with gingerbread
cakes, and set before them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>The boys were so hungry they ate two plates
full of the gingerbread cakes, and they each
drank two tall mugs of the warm milk. They
thanked the old woman very kindly, and told
her she had given them the best breakfast they
had <i>ever</i> eaten.</p>

<p>By this time the sun was quite high in the
sky. Large umbrellas were raised over small
booths on the mountain top, where men and
women were selling picture post cards and all
sorts of queer little things&mdash;horns and whistles
and small carved wooden men and bears.</p>

<p>The boys bought a number of things to
take back to America with them, and they
bought a dozen or more post cards to send to
their friends. The very prettiest of these cards
were sent to their own little brothers, Tim and
Ted, and to the Sunbonnet Babies.</p>

<p>The boys each bought, also, a fine alpine
stock to help them on their long tramps over
the mountains.</p>

<p>The first tramp was to be taken that very
day. Instead of going down Mount Rigi by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
train, as they had come up, they were going to
walk. They were going to walk away down
to the shore of the beautiful lake at the foot
of the mountain. It was the large lake of
Lucerne, but it looked like only a tiny pond,
it was so very far below them. And the busy
steamers looked like toy boats sailing on the
tiny pond.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 573px;">
<img src="images/i-030.jpg" width="573" height="456" alt="boys looking at things on table under umbrella" />
<div class="caption"><i>Large umbrellas were raised over small booths on the mountain top</i></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>"Just think," said Jack, "in a few hours we
shall be crossing that very lake in one of those
steamers. They don't look large enough to
carry people, do they?"</p>

<p>After an early lunch, which was eaten in an
outdoor restaurant, they started to walk down
the mountain. A part of the way the path was
very steep. The boys raced along, for it was
easier to run than to walk.</p>

<p>Soon they came to a place where a great
mass of rocks had slipped down across the path
during the last heavy rain. The boys could
see where the rocks had torn up bushes and
trees, as they dashed down the mountain side.</p>

<p>The little home of a herdsman, lower down
on the mountain, had been completely buried.</p>

<p>When the herdsman came home after the
rain was over, he found his house hidden under
a load of rocks and trees. Of course, the poor
man thought that his wife and six little children
had all been killed, but he would not give them
up until he had tried to save them.</p>

<p>He saw that one corner of his house was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
quite covered, so he dug away the stones as
fast as he could. Some friends came to help
him, and at last the herdsman could hear his
little children crying. This made him work even
faster, for he knew that they were alive.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 569px;">
<img src="images/i-031.jpg" width="569" height="362" alt="cabin built into the mountain" />
<div class="caption"><i>It did not lake long to make an opening through a broken window</i></div>
</div>

<p>It did not take the men long to make an
opening through a broken window. There they
found the mother and her six frightened children
sitting close together in a corner of the room.
The rest of the little house had been crushed
in by the heavy rocks. In some way this one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
corner had been protected, and so the mother
and her little family were saved.</p>

<p>Some kind herdsmen were giving the family
a home until they could build another house
on the mountain side.</p>

<p>Lower down on the trail the Overall Boys
met the father and mother and oldest daughter
of this family. They were making hay on one
of the tiny mountain meadows or alps.</p>

<p>A narrow cart had been filled with the sweet,
dry hay, and the father was about to haul it
down the trail. He greeted the Overall Boys
politely, saying in odd German, "Good evening,
my boys. May you return again to our alp."</p>

<p>When their father told the boys what the
man had said, Joe answered quickly, "Oh, thank
you! May we come up to your alp some day
and help you make your hay?"</p>

<p>And so it was arranged that the boys should
climb up to the alpine meadow some day very
soon, to help the herdsman make his hay.</p>

<p>They were going to spend two whole weeks
by Lake Lucerne at the foot of the mountain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
so they would have time to do many interesting
things.</p>

<p>After leaving the herdsman and his family,
the boys hurried on down the trail. It took
them nearly three hours to reach the shore of the
lake, where a steamer was waiting to carry them
across the water to the city of Lucerne.</p>

<p>It was one of the steamers which the Overall
Boys had seen from the top of Mount Rigi that
very morning. Away up there it had looked no
larger than a plaything, but they now found that
it was quite a grown-up boat.</p>

<h2>SHOPPING IN LUCERNE</h2>


<p>So the Overall Boys had their first sail on
lovely Lake Lucerne, the most famous lake in
all the world.</p>

<p>The sun went down in a glory of color behind
the city of Lucerne at the end of the long
lake, and the great, round moon came hurrying
up, eager to lend her light to this beautiful
part of the world while the sun was away.</p>

<p>It was a wonderful evening. It was almost
as wonderful as the evening before, when the boys
had been up above the clouds on Mount Rigi.</p>

<p>To-night they were very tired after the long
tramp down the mountain. They were too tired
to look around much as they were driven quickly
along the brightly lighted streets and up the
hill to their boarding place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>But in the morning they were ready for anything.
The first thing to interest them was breakfast.
Jack led the way down the stairs to the
large dining room, but it was empty. There
was nothing to eat on any of the long tables.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! We are too late," cried Joe. "I
shall starve before noon. I know I shall."</p>

<p>"No, you won't," said Jack. "Look out
there under the trees. The people are having
a breakfast party."</p>

<p>"Oh, my!" cried Joe. "Are we going to eat
out there, too? I hope so!"</p>

<p>"Father and mother are waiting for us over
by the tall rose bushes," said Jack. "We can
have a little table all to ourselves."</p>

<p>"Is it really a party, or is it just breakfast?"
asked Joe.</p>

<p>"I expect it is just breakfast," said Jack.
"Mother has said that people here in Switzerland
eat out of doors whenever they can."</p>

<p>"Oh, goody! let's have our breakfast out
here every morning," said Joe.</p>

<p>And so they did. Every morning when it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
did not rain, the Overall Boys had their breakfast
of rolls and honey and hot chocolate on a
small, round table in the rose garden.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 570px;">
<img src="images/i-035.jpg" width="570" height="367" alt="women embroidering" />
<div class="caption"><i>They often sat in front of their shops while working</i></div>
</div>

<p>It was lots of fun. It was almost as good
as a real picnic. Each morning while they were
eating, they planned what they should do during
the rest of the day.</p>

<p>Some days they spent the forenoon visiting
interesting little shops. They liked to watch the
pretty Swiss girls at work on their fine embroidery.
These girls, dressed in their quaint Swiss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
costumes, often sat on the sidewalk in front of
their shops while working.</p>

<p>But the boys liked best the carved wood
shops. Sometimes they saw boys, not much
older than themselves, carving jumping-jacks
and bears and queer little dwarf men out of
blocks of pear wood.</p>

<p>Many Swiss boys learn wood carving when
they are quite young, so they can earn their
living in that way when they are grown up.</p>

<p>The Overall Boys coaxed their father to buy
a fine carved bear to take home with them.
The bear was as tall as Joe. He sat on his
hind legs, crossing his fore paws in front of him,
and he looked as if he might growl any minute.</p>

<p>The boys' mother said the bear should stand
by the front door at home, where he could hold
umbrellas for people when they came to call.</p>

<p>"What fun we shall have when we introduce
the Sunbonnet Babies to Mr. Bear!" said Joe.</p>

<p>"I know a fine way to do it," said Jack.
"We will stand him under the big maple tree
in the back yard at home. Then, the first time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
Molly and May come to see us, we will take
them out to meet our new playmate."</p>

<p>"Oh, that will be great!" shouted Joe. "I
can almost hear Molly and May scream now."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Let's visit the cuckoo shop," said Jack one
afternoon. "And let's try to be there when the
cuckoos all come out."</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 144px;">
<img src="images/i-036.jpg" width="144" height="431" alt="ornate cuckoo clock" />
<div class="caption"><i>A cuckoo clock</i></div>
</div>
<p>"Well, then, let's go now," said Joe. "It is
ten minutes of five. We shall have just time
to get there before the clocks begin to strike
and the cuckoos begin to call for five o'clock."</p>

<p>So Jack and Joe hurried down the street
into the old, old part of the city. They found
the little shop just in time. An old man standing
in the doorway invited the boys to go in,
and of course they accepted.</p>

<p>On the walls around the small room hung
many beautiful brown clocks of all sizes. They
were very different from American clocks. These
clocks looked like tiny Swiss houses or chalets.
There was a round clock face in the front of
each chalet, and two long swinging arms hanging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
down below. But the clocks were all saying,
<i>tick</i>, <i>tick</i>, <i>tick</i>, <i>tick</i>, just as American clocks do.</p>

<p>"Now watch!" cried Joe. "The doors are
beginning to open. Here come
the cuckoos."</p>

<p>And sure enough, as the boys
stood looking at the clocks, a little
door near the top of each swung
quickly open and a tiny cuckoo bird
stepped out and flapped its wings.</p>

<p>The clocks all began striking and
the cuckoos began calling just like
this:&mdash;One, cuckoo; two, cuckoo;
three, cuckoo; four, cuckoo; five,
cuckoo.</p>

<p>It was five o'clock. The cuckoo
birds folded their wings and stepped
quietly back into their tiny houses.
The doors closed quickly in front of them and
all was still once more, except for the <i>tick</i>, <i>tick</i>
of the many clocks.</p>



<p>"We just <i>must</i> buy one of those cuckoo
clocks to take back to America with us," said Joe.</p>

<p>"We must buy two of them," said Jack.
"We must take one to Molly and May. They
will think it is splendid."</p>

<p>"Let's ask father about it," said Joe. "I
know he will tell us to buy one for the Sunbonnet
Babies and one for Tim and Ted."</p>

<p>"I am going home to supper now," said Jack.
"This is Saturday, and there are fireworks on
the shore of the lake every Saturday evening,
you know."</p>

<p>"Oh, so there are!" cried Joe. "I had almost
forgotten about them. Let's hurry."</p>

<h2>SATURDAY EVENING ON
LAKE LUCERNE</h2>


<p>Long before it was dark the Overall Boys
were walking up and down the beautiful shore
front, waiting for the first sky rocket. Hundreds
of other people were waiting and watching, too.
A band was playing and everybody was happy.</p>

<p>"Listen! The band is playing <i>America</i>!"
cried Joe. "Three cheers for the red, white, and
blue!"</p>

<p>"Wait a minute, Joe," said Jack. "Father
says that is one of the national hymns of Switzerland.
The music is the same as for our
national hymn, <i>America</i>, but the words are
different."</p>

<p>"It is fine, anyway, and I feel like shouting.&mdash;Three
cheers for Switzerland!" said Joe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>"So do I!" said Jack. "Switzerland is a
Republic and has a President, just as we have
in the United States, you know. Its national
motto is 'All for each, and each for all.'"</p>

<p>"I thought it seemed more like home than
any other country over here," said Joe. "I
shouldn't like to live in a country which has
a King instead of a President. I like Presidents."</p>

<p>"But just think of it, Joe, the whole of Switzerland
is only one third as large as our state
of New York, and the city of New York has a
million more people in it than this whole country
has; father said so."</p>

<p>"Well, even though the country is so small,"
said Joe, "it has twenty-two Cantons or states,
and each Canton has a special flag. I am
going to buy them all for my flag collection."</p>

<p>"Puff! puff! There goes a sky rocket!"
shouted Jack. "And there goes another! The
fun has begun, Joe!"</p>

<p>During the next hour the boys forgot all
about national hymns and Presidents and flags.
They were watching fire balloons sail far out over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
the dark lake and disappear behind tall mountains.
They were watching rockets shoot high
into the sky and burst into wonderful shapes&mdash;into
ships and bears and pots of flowers. They
were watching the mountains glow under lovely
red and blue and yellow lights. And they were
imagining that they were in a fairy city, beside
a fairy lake, with the wonderful mountains of
Fairyland all around them.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 578px;">

</div>

<p>After awhile the boys and their father got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
into a small boat and rowed far out on the
dark fairy lake. Other boats were floating
quietly about, too, each carrying a lighted
Chinese lantern.</p>

<p>Somewhere across the water people were singing
lovely Swiss songs, and all were watching
the strange, fiery things in the sky above.</p>

<p>Mount Pilatus, which rose very high, close
beside the lake, looked cold and ghostlike under
the weird, blue lights.</p>

<p>"Would you like to hear a ghost story about
Mount Pilatus, boys?" asked their father.</p>

<p>"Oh, of course we should! Please tell us a
ghost story!" said the boys.</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 222px;">
<img src="images/i-041.jpg" width="222" height="618" alt="more fireworks" />
<div class="caption"><i>A fire balloon</i></div>
</div>
<p>"Well," began their father, "you know how
Pilate, the Roman governor of Galilee, allowed
Jesus to be killed. It is said that Pilate was
afterward driven out of Galilee, and that he
came to this part of the world and drowned
himself in a lake near the top of that mountain.
So the mountain was named Pilatus.</p>

<p>"For many hundreds of years the people
about here believed that Pilate's ghost came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
out of the lake once a year and wandered over
the mountain. To protect the people from the
ghost, the government of Lucerne forbade any
one to go near the lake.</p>

<p>"Once six bold men disobeyed this law, and
they were put into prison. The people still
believed that Pilate's ghost lived on the mountain,
and they did not want to offend it.</p>

<p>"It was not until fifteen hundred years after
Pilate was driven from Galilee that the government
of Lucerne gave permission for four men
to climb the mountain and to explore the lake.
As the men did not find the ghost, they decided
that at last it was quiet.</p>

<p>"So people have been climbing the mountain
ever since, and now they even have a railroad
which goes away up to the little lake. How
do you suppose the old ghost likes that?"</p>

<p>"And what do you suppose he thinks of the
fire balloons that are sailing around his head
to-night?" said Joe.</p>

<p>Suddenly somebody screamed, and then somebody
else screamed. The little boats began to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
hurry and scurry in every
direction. It looked as if
all the Chinese lanterns had
gone crazy.</p>

<p>Everybody's eyes were
turned toward the sky, for up
there, right above them, was
a fire balloon. The fire had
caught in the top of the balloon,
and it was all ablaze.</p>

<p>Now this blazing balloon
was falling straight down,
down, down, toward the
little boats on the lake. Of
course the boats were scurrying
to get out of the way, and
of course the people screamed.</p>



<p>Each thought that the
burning balloon would
surely fall right into his
boat, but it did not. It fell hissing and sputtering
into the dark waters, right where the boats
had been only a few moments before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, that was a narrow escape!" exclaimed
Jack. "We can imagine now how it would
seem to be in a falling flying machine. I think
I don't care to try it."</p>

<p>Then, with many other boats, they rowed
quickly back to the brightly lighted city, and
the boys were soon sound asleep, resting for the
next day's fun.</p>

<h2>THE BIRTHDAY PARTY</h2>


<p>Now the next day was Joe's birthday, and
he was to have a real Swiss party. At least,
he was going with a dozen Swiss boys and their
schoolmaster for a long tramp up the mountain
side behind Lucerne. Jack was going, too.</p>

<p>The boys were hardly through breakfast on
the birthday morning, when they heard the beating
of a drum in the street. In a moment the
high garden gate swung open, and in marched
a procession of jolly boys.</p>

<p>The leader of the procession was the drummer
boy. A great St. Bernard dog bounded
along beside him.</p>

<p>These boys could all speak a little English,
and as Jack and Joe had learned some German,
they had no trouble in talking with each other,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
though sometimes it was hard for the St. Bernard
dog to understand their language.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 582px;">
<img src="images/i-045.jpg" width="582" height="382" alt="hiking" />
<div class="caption"><i>The drummer boy and the schoolmaster and the dog led the way, while the other boys followed, two by two</i></div>
</div>

<p>The Overall Boys put on their knapsacks
and quickly joined the procession. The drummer
boy and the schoolmaster and the dog
led the way, while the other boys followed,
two by two.</p>

<p>Swiss boys nearly always carry knapsacks
or botany cans on their backs when they are
tramping. They like to gather and study the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
wild flowers and plants that grow by the way.
Of course they always carry fresh rolls and
sweet chocolate in their knapsacks, too.</p>

<p>These boys think nothing is so good for
lunch as rolls and sweet chocolate, and the
Overall Boys are sure that they are right. They
are also sure that no other sweet chocolate is
as good as that made in Switzerland.</p>

<p>The Swiss schoolboys often wear soft green
felt hats with bunches of mountain flowers or
long feathers standing straight up behind. So
the Overall Boys bought feathers for their
hats, too.</p>

<p>In passing through the town the schoolmaster
took the boys to see their famous
national monument, the Lion of Lucerne.</p>

<p>High on a natural wall of rock they saw
the figure of a great dying lion, with a broken
spear in his side. At the foot of the wall
there is a small, dark pond with green trees
around it, making a quiet and beautiful spot.</p>

<p>The schoolmaster told the boys how, many
years before, some brave Swiss guards had given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
their lives to protect the palace of the French
King, Louis XVI, in his beautiful city of Paris.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 579px;">
<img src="images/i-046.jpg" width="579" height="364" alt="HELVETIORUM FIDEI AC VIRTUTI; DIE X AUGUSTI II ET III SEPTEMBRIS MDCCXCII" />
<div class="caption"><i>High on a natural wall of rock they saw the famous national monument, the Lion of Lucerne</i></div>
</div>

<p>He told them how this national monument
had later been made by a great artist in memory
of the soldiers who were as brave as lions,
and who were not afraid to die at their post.</p>

<p>After leaving the lion, the boys marched down
the steep, crooked streets toward the river.
Mount Pilatus rose high in front of them, a
soft, white cloud above his head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 569px;">
<img src="images/i-047.jpg" width="569" height="360" alt="looking a a milk cart pulled by dogs" />
<div class="caption"><i>They passed a number of small milk carts</i></div>
</div>

<p>"We are sure of fine weather to-day, boys,"
said the master. "Pilatus is wearing his hood.</p>

<div class='poem'>
'If Pilatus wears his hood,<br />
Then the weather's always good.'"<br />
</div>

<p>"He is celebrating my birthday," said Joe.
"Of course the weather must be good to-day."</p>

<p>As the boys tramped on they passed a number
of small milk carts bringing barrels of fresh,
rich milk into the city. The milk had been
sent down from the high mountain pastures,
where the cattle spend the summer months.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>Each milk cart was drawn by two strong
dogs and a man. The dogs seemed very proud
of their work. They knew every house where
they must stop to leave the morning's milk.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the party was crossing a
queer, crooked bridge over the river. It is
called the Chapel Bridge. On its roof and
walls there are more than one hundred and
fifty pictures, which were painted a long, long
time ago.</p>

<p>Right beside the bridge, standing in the
river, is a very old stone tower. The schoolmaster
said that this tower was probably once
used as a lighthouse.</p>

<p>The Overall Boys were very much interested
in the quaint old covered bridge, but they were
even more interested in some beautiful white
swans swimming in the water below it.</p>

<p>"The swans are hunting for their breakfast,"
said Joe. "I am going to give them one of
my nice rolls."</p>

<p>Then Joe ran quickly through the bridge
and down to the edge of the river. He took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
one of the fresh, long rolls from his knapsack
and broke it into small bits, which he threw
into the water.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i-048.jpg" width="600" height="350" alt="feeding swans" />
<div class="caption"><i>He took one of the fresh, long rolls from his knapsack and fed the swans on the river</i></div>
</div>

<p>In a moment the lovely white swans were
sailing swiftly toward him. They bowed their
long, graceful necks in many a pretty "Thank
you" for the generous breakfast.</p>

<p>At last the procession tramped out through
a low gate under a large watch tower on the old
city wall. Soon they were climbing up through
the beautiful woods on the mountain side.</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 181px;">
<img src="images/i-049.jpg" width="181" height="366" alt="flowers" />
<div class="caption"><i>Alpine roses</i></div>
</div>
<p>They found many interesting plants and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
flowers to study, and they were glad of the
sweet chocolate and rolls in their knapsacks.</p>

<p>But the real fun came when they reached
the restaurant high on the mountain. One of
the boys kept Joe out of sight while the others
helped arrange a table for the birthday dinner.</p>



<p>It was a large, round table, and it stood
out of doors on a high terrace,
where they could look far
down upon the little city of
Lucerne, and upon the beautiful
lake surrounded by the great
mountains.</p>

<p>The boys took from their
knapsacks a number of small
packages, which they had kept
a secret from Joe.</p>

<p>"Let's arrange all of our
presents around Joe's plate,"
said Jack. "And let's put a
bunch of alpine roses in the center of the table."</p>

<p>In a few moments a procession of carved
wooden bears and queer little dwarf men were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
marching around Joe's plate, while on the plate
were piled the other presents.</p>

<p>There was a handsome jackknife; a pocket
book containing a silver franc piece, which is the
same as twenty cents; a tiny Swiss chalet with a
real music box inside of it; and best of all, a
beautiful little Swiss watch,&mdash;one which would
keep perfect time,&mdash;besides cakes and cakes of
delicious sweet chocolate.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 575px;">
<img src="images/i-050.jpg" width="575" height="361" alt="groupl singing" />
<div class="caption"><i>The boys stood around the table and sang</i></div>
</div>

<p>When everything was ready, the boys stood
behind their chairs around the table and sang<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
a birthday song, while Joe was led back to
the terrace by his little Swiss friend.</p>

<p>Poor Joe! He was so surprised and so happy
he did not know what to do or what to say,
but he really said the very nicest thing: "Thank
you, thank you, everybody! Oh, ich danke euch
allen!" Then he sat down quickly in his chair
and began looking at his many presents.</p>

<p>But he could not look at his presents long,
for he had to think about the delicious birthday
dinner that was being served. There was
everything that hungry boys could wish for,
from real chicken to ice cream and cake. And
there was a box of chocolate candy for each
boy to take home with him.</p>

<p>A Swiss band played lovely music all the
while they were eating, and the schoolmaster
told them wonderful stories about his life on
the high Alps when he was a little boy.</p>

<p>The boys ate so long, and they ate so much,
the schoolmaster finally told them that they
must stop soon or they would not be able to
tramp back down the mountain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>There was no need to be anxious, however,
for they all tramped down better than they
had tramped up.</p>

<p>Joe did not complain once because of the
extra weight in his knapsack. It had been the
finest birthday that he had <i>ever</i> known.</p>

<h2>WILLIAM TELL AND HIS LITTLE SON</h2>


<p>Early next morning the Overall Boys and
their parents went aboard a small steamer which
would carry them to the other end of the long,
narrow lake of Lucerne.</p>

<p>They hurried quickly to the front upper
deck, for they had long ago learned that this
was the best place for sightseeing; and they
knew that during the next few hours they
would see some of the loveliest scenery in
the whole world.</p>

<p>"I believe this will be the finest trip we
have had yet," said Joe.</p>

<p>"I know it will be the finest one!" exclaimed
Jack. "I should rather see the spot where
William Tell shot the apple from his little
boy's head, than any other spot in Switzerland."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I shouldn't!" said Joe. "I should
rather climb one of those great mountains all
covered with snow, and take a walk on a real
glacier."</p>

<p>"Well, some day perhaps we can do that,
too," said Jack. "But I don't want to do it
to-day. I want to hear the story which father
is going to tell us, about how William Tell
and his little boy helped to make Switzerland
a free country."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, father! Do tell us the story while
we are sailing up the very lake where a part of
it happened," said Joe.</p>

<p>"All right," said their father. "This is the
story:</p>

<p>"More than six hundred years ago the people
of Switzerland did not govern themselves, as
they do now. A part of the people were
governed by the King of Austria. Austria is
a large country northeast of Switzerland, you
know.</p>

<p>"Now the King of Austria could not live
here and govern the people himself, so he sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
one of his men to be their Governor. The
name of the last Governor was Gessler.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 576px;">
<img src="images/i-054.jpg" width="576" height="367" alt="Boys on deck of boat" />
<div class="caption"><i>The Overall Boys hear the story of William Tell</i></div>
</div>

<p>"This man Gessler was a very proud and
cruel Governor. He made the people do many
things which they did not think were right.</p>

<p>"One of the strange things which Gessler did
was to have a hat placed on a tall pole in the
marketplace of the little village of Altdorf.
He then commanded every one who passed
through the marketplace to bow before the hat,
just as if the King of Austria were sitting there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>"A watchman stood near by to take the
names of any who did not obey the command.</p>

<p>"Of course the people were much excited,
but they did not dare to disobey the Governor.
At least no one dared to do so until, one day,
William Tell came to the marketplace. He
was a proud and brave man. He thought it
was foolish to bow to a hat on a pole, so he
walked straight by it without bowing.</p>

<p>"When Gessler heard what William Tell
had done, he was very angry. As a punishment,
he commanded Tell to shoot an apple
placed on the head of his favorite son, Walter.
If the arrow went through the apple, Tell's
life was to be spared. But if he missed the
mark, he and his little boy were to die.</p>

<p>"Gessler knew that William Tell could shoot
an arrow straighter than any other man in the
country, but he thought that his courage would
fail, with his own little boy standing just
under the mark. And it almost did fail. But
Walter called, 'Shoot, father! I am not afraid!
I will stand very still!'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>"So Tell placed an arrow in his crossbow
and another one in his belt. Gessler stood the
boy under a tree some distance away, and
placed an apple on his head. He then commanded
Tell to shoot.</p>

<p>"In a moment Tell's arrow had gone straight
through the center of the apple.</p>

<p>"The people, who were watching, shouted
for joy, because the lives of William Tell and
his brave little son were saved. Even Gessler
was forced to praise Tell for his wonderful skill.</p>

<p>"'But,' said Gessler, 'you must tell me why
you put the second arrow in your belt.'</p>

<p>"Tell did not wish to answer this question,
but Gessler promised he should not lose his life.</p>

<p>"'Well, sir,' answered Tell, 'as you have
promised to spare my life, I will tell you the
truth. If I had missed the apple and shot my
boy, the second arrow should have gone through
your heart.'</p>

<p>"'Ah!' said Gessler. 'I have promised to
spare your life, but you shall be put where you
will never again see the sun nor the moon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
Then I shall be safe from your swift arrows.'</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 578px;">
<img src="images/i-055.jpg" width="578" height="440" alt="man on horseback in crowd" />
<div class="caption"><i>Gessler asks Tell about the second arrow</i></div>
</div>

<p>"So William Tell was quickly bound with
ropes and taken to the boat on which Gessler
was to cross the lake in returning to his castle.</p>

<p>"While they were on the water a terrible
storm came up. It seemed as if they would
all be drowned. The boatmen begged Gessler
to take the ropes from their prisoner, so that
he might help them bring the boat ashore.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 573px;">
<img src="images/i-056.jpg" width="573" height="388" alt="Boys looking at picture of Tell story" />
<div class="caption"><i>As he sprang, he gave the boat a strong push with his foot, back into the rough water again</i></div>
</div>

<p>"So Gessler commanded that Tell be untied
and that he guide them to safety.</p>

<p>"Tell had been on this lake in storms many
times before, and he knew where the few safe
landing places were. He knew there was a
large flat rock, close under the steep shore,
on to which one could easily spring from a boat,
so he skillfully steered in its direction.</p>

<p>"When a great wave swung the tossing
boat quite close to the flat rock, Tell seized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
his crossbow and sprang out. As he sprang,
he gave the boat a strong push with his foot,
back into the rough water again.</p>

<p>"Brave Tell was free. He climbed quickly
through the woods and up the steep mountain
side. At last he came to the path Gessler
would have to take in returning to his castle,
if he were not drowned on the stormy lake.</p>

<p>"Here Tell waited and thought. He was
waiting to see if Gessler would come, and he
was thinking about the brave people who were
being so cruelly treated by their Austrian
Governor. He was willing, if necessary, to
give his life to bring freedom to his country.</p>

<p>"At last Gessler and his men came hurrying
up the path toward the castle. They had
escaped the storm.</p>

<p>"As Tell stood hidden behind some bushes
near the path he saw Gessler refuse to help a
poor woman and her little children. The
woman had come to beg the Governor to release
her husband, who had been unjustly put
into prison. Gessler would not listen to her,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
and the unhappy woman went away weeping.</p>

<p>"Tell was now sure that it was his duty to
save his people from their suffering. So he
let fly a swift arrow from his bow and it hit
the mark, as his arrows always did.</p>

<p>"That was the last of Austrian Governors
for Switzerland. The people have been free
and have governed themselves ever since, and
that, you know, is more than six hundred years,"
said the boys' father.</p>

<p>"Isn't it wonderful to be as brave as
William Tell was!" said Jack after a moment.</p>

<p>"And isn't it wonderful to be as brave as
Walter was!" said Joe. "I wonder if I could
be as brave as that!"</p>

<h2>A VISIT TO TELL'S COUNTRY</h2>


<p>While the boys were listening to this interesting
story, the steamer was carrying them
slowly up the beautiful lake toward the very
places where it all happened.</p>

<p>At last they came to a narrow part of the
lake where the mountains rose steep and high
on both sides.</p>

<p>"Look, boys!" said their father. "Do you
see the little chapel just ahead of us, on the
left? It is called Tell's Chapel, because it is
built on the flat rock on to which Tell sprang
from Gessler's boat that stormy day. On the
walls inside of the chapel an artist has painted
four large pictures showing the whole story of
William Tell."</p>

<p>"Oh, father, please let us go ashore here,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
said Jack. "I want to look at those pictures."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 578px;">
<img src="images/i-060.jpg" width="578" height="400" alt="Chapel beside lake" />
<div class="caption">"<i>Do you see the little chapel just ahead of us?</i>"</div>
</div>

<p>"And I want to climb up into the dark
woods behind the chapel," said Joe.</p>

<p>"All right," said their father. "How would
you like to walk the rest of the way to
the end of the lake? It is only two or three
miles. I am sure you never have walked over
so beautiful a road as this one."</p>

<p>"Oh, do let us walk!" shouted Joe. "It will
be lots more fun than sitting still here on the
steamer."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>So they went ashore right near the little
chapel. First, they looked at the pictures that
told the story of Tell and Gessler, on the walls
inside of the chapel. Then they followed a
steep, narrow path that led up the mountain side
through the dark woods. This path soon brought
them to a pretty garden restaurant.</p>

<p>Of course they were all very thirsty, so
they sat around a small table under the great
trees and drank raspberry lemonade, which was
served to them in very tall glasses. Raspberry
lemonade, as it is made in Switzerland, is much
nicer than plain lemonade, at least so the Overall
Boys thought.</p>

<p>A few minutes later they began their tramp
over one of the most beautiful roads in the
world. It is called the Axenstrasse, because it
is built along the side of the steep mountain
called the Axenberg.</p>

<p>A part of the way the mountain is so steep
the road could not be built on the outside of
it, so a tunnel has been cut right through the
rocky side. Here and there the outer wall of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
rock has been cut away, making great arches
through which people can look out over the
beautiful lake to the high mountains beyond.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 574px;">
<img src="images/i-061.jpg" width="574" height="385" alt="standing under great carved arches" />
<div class="caption"><i>The great arches from which people can see the high mountains beyond</i></div>
</div>

<p>The famous St. Gotthard railroad is also
built along this mountain side. In some places
the trains glide along the steep mountain almost
straight above the deep lake, and in other
places they pass through long, dark tunnels.</p>

<p>The carriage road over which the Overall
Boys were tramping was as smooth and level as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
a floor. Many automobiles flew past the happy
walking party, but the boys did not envy the
people who were riding in them. They could see
and enjoy everything, while those who had to
ride missed a great deal.</p>

<p>They passed through two or three small
villages, where the narrow balconies on the
pretty chalets were all covered with beautiful
climbing roses.</p>

<p>In the center of a fountain, in one of the
small flower gardens, the boys saw the figure of
a queer little dwarf with a large, red umbrella
over his head.</p>

<p>"Oh, Jack, see that little man standing in the
fountain!" cried Joe. "He looks like the good
dwarfs we read about in fairy tales. See what
a small body he has, and what a large head!"</p>

<p>"And do look at his long beard and his
high, pointed cap!" said Jack. "How proud he
is of his big, red umbrella! He stands in the
center of the fountain with the water falling
all around, but not a drop falls on him."</p>

<p>"Isn't he a jolly old fellow! I suppose he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
brings good luck to the people who own
that garden," said Joe. "In fairy tales the
mountain dwarfs always bring good luck, if
they are treated kindly."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 584px;">
<img src="images/i-062.jpg" width="584" height="372" alt="Statue of dwarf holding umbrella" />
<div class="caption"><i>The queer little dwarf under his large, red umbrella</i></div>
</div>

<p>"Well, this old fellow looks as if he were
enjoying his lovely garden home," said Jack.</p>

<p>At last the trampers came to a small town
where there was a high coach drawn by four
horses waiting to carry people two miles up
the valley, to the village of Altdorf.</p>

<p>Travelers usually go to Altdorf by train<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
now, but the Overall Boys chose to ride on
top of the high coach.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i-063.jpg" width="600" height="360" alt="boys riding on coach" />
<div class="caption"><i>The Overall Boys chose to ride on top of the high coach</i></div>
</div>

<p>It was a beautiful drive, and everybody was
happy and hungry when the coach drew up to
a small hotel in the famous little village.</p>

<p>Supper was served in the hotel garden, then
the boys went to bed to dream of William Tell
and his brave son, Walter, who had once walked
the streets of this very village.</p>

<p>Quite early next morning, two eager little
boys were standing in the old marketplace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
They were looking at the tall bronze monument
of William Tell and his little son.</p>

<p>"Think of it!" said Joe. "William Tell
stood on this very spot when he shot the apple
from Walter's head."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Jack. "And Walter stood away
back there, where the fountain now is."</p>

<p>"My! I know I should have trembled, if
I had been in Walter's place," said Joe.</p>

<p>"I am sure Walter did not tremble. See
how brave and happy he looks, as he stands
up there with his father's hand on his shoulder.
He was proud to help save his father's life.
He was even willing to die to save him. Why,
I should be willing to do as much for my
father, if he were in trouble," said Jack.</p>

<p>"So should I!" cried Joe. "No one shall
ever hurt father or mother, if I can help it!"</p>

<p>"Well, that sounds good," said their father,
who came up behind the boys just in time to
hear what they were talking about. "I shall
not be afraid to serve my country, so long as
I have boys as brave as Walter Tell."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 577px;">
<img src="images/i-064.jpg" width="577" height="359" alt="boys standing on balcony looking at monument" />
<div class="caption"><i>They were looking at the monument of William Tell</i></div>
</div>

<p>"Oh, father, did this all really happen, or
is it just a story?" asked Jack.</p>

<p>"Well," said their father, "a few wise men
are telling us that it is only a legend, but
many of the Swiss people believe that it is
every bit true. They are proud to have had
such heroes as William Tell and his little boy."</p>

<p>"Of course they are," said Joe. "I am
going to believe that it is true. Why, William
Tell did almost as much for his country as
George Washington did for ours. I think that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
he ought to be called the 'Father of his Country,'
the same as Washington is."</p>

<p>"So do I," said their father. "But let me
tell you something now. I have a surprise for
you. The people of the village are going to
play the story of William Tell to-day in their
little open-air theater on the edge of the woods.</p>

<p>"The king's hat will be there on a pole in
the center of the busy marketplace, and all
the people will bow low to it&mdash;all except
William Tell and his little son, who will
march proudly by it. Then, of course, Tell
will have to shoot the apple from his little
boy's head, and he will be taken across the
stormy lake in Gessler's boat, and then he
will spring out upon the rocky shore, and
escape into the woods. Gessler and his men
will climb up the mountain path toward the
castle; the poor woman will beg Gessler to
release her husband from prison&mdash;and all the
rest of the story will be played. Would you
like to see it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, of course we should!" exclaimed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
boys. "We should rather see it than anything
else we can think of."</p>

<p>And when they had seen it, they wanted to
see it all right over again.</p>

</div>




<h2>OVER AND THROUGH THE MOUNTAINS</h2>


<p>Slowly, slowly up the mountain crept the
long train. It was carrying the Overall Boys
far away from lovely Lake Lucerne. It was
taking them over the wonderful Br&uuml;nig Pass.
It was carrying them even more slowly down,
down the steep slope on the other side toward
the head of the deep valley, where lay the
pretty Swiss village of Meiringen.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 311px;">
<img src="images/i-068.jpg" width="311" height="512" alt="Stone trestle bridges" />
<div class="caption"><i>They glided over high bridges</i></div>
</div>
<p>As the boys stood by the car window they
could see the long line of track far below them.
Sometimes when their train passed a sharp curve,
they could even see the engine at one end of
the train and the last car at the other end.</p>

<p>They glided over high bridges above torrents
of water which dashed down the mountain to
join the blue lake in the valley below.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>It was wonderful&mdash;the mountains, the torrents,
the lakes, and the strong train which
carried them over everything! It was all so
wonderful, the boys
had no words to express
their delight.
For the first time on
their long journey
they were almost
silent.</p>

<p>Once in a while
one of the boys
would cry: "Look
at that great waterfall!"
or "See the
precipice right below
us!" or "Watch
us cross that high
bridge!"</p>

<p>It was much
more exciting than the ride in the thunder storm
up Mount Rigi, but at last even this ride came
to an end.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>Yes, the wonderful ride over the Br&uuml;nig Pass
ended at Meiringen, but the more wonderful
tramp over the Great Scheidegg Pass was to
begin at Meiringen, and the boys were to have
other strange experiences down in the deep,
green valley. The most exciting of them all
came the very next morning.</p>

<p>There was an early breakfast eaten in the
pretty garden of the hotel, then their father said:</p>

<p>"Now for the fun! Yesterday we went <i>over</i>
a mountain. To-day we shall go <i>through</i> one."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 570px;">
<img src="images/i-069.jpg" width="570" height="357" alt="boys looking out windows of train" />
<div class="caption"><i>The boys had no words to express their delight</i></div>
</div>


<p>"Are we going through a tunnel?" cried Joe.</p>

<p>"No, indeed!" said their father. "At least
it is not a tunnel made by men. Come and
see what you think of it."</p>

<p>They were soon tramping along the village
street toward the high mountain at the head of
the narrow valley. A swift river hurried past
them to join the lake at the other end of the
valley. It was the river Aar.</p>

<p>The boys saw where the river had overflowed
its banks in the springtime, when the
snows melted and the heavy rains came. They
were told that the bridges were often washed
away, and that sometimes great masses of rocks
came tearing down the mountain side, right
into the little village, crushing and burying
everything in their path.</p>

<p>The party quickly left the village far behind
them, and each step brought them nearer to the
high mountain wall close ahead.</p>

<p>"How shall we get over that mountain,
father?" asked Joe. "Shall we have to climb
to the top?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, Joe," said his father. "We shall do no
climbing to-day. I believe we can go through it,
if this swift river can."</p>

<p>"Of course we can!" shouted Jack. "Let's
follow the river."</p>

<p>So they followed a footpath along the banks
of the noisy river. Soon the banks began to
grow high and steep. At last they rose straight
up on both sides, until the boys could see only
a narrow strip of blue sky far above them.</p>

<p>"The mountain has cracked open!" shouted
Joe. "We are in the crack!"</p>

<p>"So we are!" cried Jack. "I believe the
river did it. See it come tearing along!"</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 266px;">
<img src="images/i-070.jpg" width="266" height="482" alt="boys between very high cliffs" />
<div class="caption"><i>The path through the mountain</i></div>
</div>
<p>"Look ahead of us!" said Joe. "There
isn't room even for a path. A board walk has
been fastened with iron rods to the wall. It
hangs right over the rushing water. What if it
should break while we are on it! I am not sure
that I want to go any farther."</p>

<p>"Come, now, don't be a coward, Joe," said
his father. "The Swiss government builds these
paths, and they are built strong. We are safe."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>So on they tramped through the great crack
in the mountain. In some places the path hung
high over the swift waters. In other places it
was tunneled through
the dark rocks. But
always it followed the
deep, narrow crack, with
the noisy river at its
bottom and a bit of blue
sky far, far above.</p>

<p>For nearly a mile the
boys followed this path.
In many places the river
was so noisy they had to
shout to make each other
hear. But at last they
came out on the other
side of the mountain.</p>


<p>They had not climbed
the mountain, and they had not gone around it.
They had gone <i>through</i> it. And more wonderful
still, the great river Aar has been carrying its
waters through the mountain for ages and ages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>Close beside the river, at the end of the
path, was a tiny shop kept by a little old
woman and her granddaughter.</p>

<p>The little girl served the boys to raspberry
lemonade, and she sold them picture post cards
showing the strange path over which they had
just come.</p>

<p>Then back they went into the mountain
crack&mdash;over the footpath hanging high above
the rushing water, and through the small, dark
tunnels, until once more they were in the
lovely green valley of Meiringen.</p>

<h2>REAL TRAMPERS</h2>


<p>Next morning the boys were up with the
sun, for there was a long journey ahead of
them. It was not to be a journey by train
nor by boat. It was to be a journey on foot.</p>

<p>The party was to follow a trail over the
high mountain range which shuts in the deep
valley of the river Aar on the south. The
trail would lead them over the Great Scheidegg
Pass and down into the beautiful valleys on
the other side.</p>

<p>They were going to spend at least a week
on the way. There would be so many interesting
things to see and to do, they would not
want to hurry.</p>

<p>The boys carried knapsacks on their backs,
in which they put the few things they would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
need while crossing the mountains. They were
real trampers at last.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 575px;">
<img src="images/i-074.jpg" width="575" height="382" alt="hiknig on path with fences on either side" />
<div class="caption"><i>They carried knapsacks on their backs, in which they put the few things they would need while crossing the mountains</i></div>
</div>

<p>The first part of the trail was very steep.
The little party climbed up and up, until the
village, far below them, looked very small indeed.</p>

<p>After awhile they heard a strange rumbling
noise, which grew louder and louder the higher
they climbed. Soon it became a roar, and right
above their path they saw a tremendous waterfall
tumbling down over the steep mountain side.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
It fairly made the rocks tremble, it fell with
such force, and the air was filled with a fine,
wet spray.</p>

<p>The boys sprang up the path close beside
the great waterfall. When they reached the
top of it they were a very wet but a very
jolly party.</p>

<p>"Well, that's the most fun we have had
yet!" shouted Joe. "I should like to do it
right over again."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't," said a little girl who was
standing near by. "I have to come up here
every few days. I don't like to get so wet."</p>

<p>"Why do you come up so often?" asked
Jack.</p>

<p>"I go down to the village to buy bread for
mother. I live up here. That is our chalet up
there by the brook. My name is Gretel."</p>

<p>"Do you go down to the village to school,
too?" asked Joe.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered the little girl. "But this
is vacation time now. I often take another
path when I go to school. Sometimes I ride<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
home on that big car, which helps me up the
mountain as far as the waterfall."</p>

<p>"Do you go to school all winter?" asked
Jack.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! except when the snow is so deep I
just can't get there. All of us girls and boys
have to go to school forty weeks every year.
I am glad we do. I like to go to school."</p>

<p>"Please let us carry that basket of bread
for you," said Jack. "I think our path goes
right by your house."</p>

<p>So the children walked on up the path
together, and Gretel told the boys many
interesting things about her life on the mountain
alp.</p>

<p>"I always thought a Swiss alp was a high
mountain peak," said Joe.</p>

<p>"Oh, no! An alp is a lovely mountain
meadow," said Gretel. "See what a fine great
alp ours is. This is one of the low alps.
Father raises lots of hay here to feed the cows
during the long winter."</p>

<p>"Where are your cows now?" asked Jack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 575px;">
<img src="images/i-075.jpg" width="575" height="371" alt="House in mountains" />
<div class="caption"><i>Gretel's home was a pretty, brown chalet, whose roof was covered with large stones to keep it from being blown away</i></div>
</div>

<p>"They are feeding farther up on the higher
alps," said Gretel. "Father takes them up
early every summer, and they don't come down
until fall."</p>

<p>"Do you think we shall see them on our
way over the mountains?" asked Joe.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am sure you will," said Gretel.
"Your path goes right across the alp where
father's little cabin is. My two brothers,
Franz and Sep, are up there with father now.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
They take care of the goats, and help to milk
the cows and make the cheese. I wish I were
up there, too!"</p>

<p>"Why can't you go up with us?" asked
Jack. "You could surprise your father and
brothers."</p>

<p>"Oh, I should love to go!" cried Gretel.
"I could stay with them in their little cabin
for a few days, then Franz would bring me
home, I know he would. I will ask mother if
I may go. See, this is our chalet."</p>

<p>It was a pretty, brown chalet. The broad,
low roof was covered with many large stones
to keep it from being blown away during the
great winter storms.</p>

<p>But now it was the lovely summer time,
and Gretel's mother had set two small tables
just outside her front door. She always had
something good to serve to hungry trampers
To-day there was a big bowl of delicious wild
strawberries on each of the tables.</p>

<p>Of course the Overall Boys were suddenly
very hungry. And how they enjoyed the bread<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
and butter and wild strawberries and cream
which Gretel's mother served to them!</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 577px;">
<img src="images/i-076.jpg" width="577" height="376" alt="tables in yard, boys looking at them with lady and girl" />
<div class="caption"><i>After the tea party was over, Gretel showed them yards and yards of lace she was making</i></div>
</div>

<p>After the tea party was over, Gretel showed
them the lace which she was making. There
were yards and yards of it. The boys thought
it was wonderful to see Gretel move the bobbins
of thread so quickly over the big pillow, and
never make mistakes in the pattern.</p>

<p>"I have been making lace ever since I was
five years old," said Gretel. "I sell enough lace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
every summer to pay for all of my clothes."</p>

<p>"Oh, Gretel, will you sell some to us?"
asked Joe. "We don't wear lace ourselves,
but the Sunbonnet Babies do. They would
love to wear some of your lace."</p>

<p>"And I should love to have them wear it.
Of course I will sell you some," said Gretel.</p>

<p>Then the boys chose some of the very prettiest
lace Gretel had made, and bought it for
the Sunbonnet Babies.</p>

<p>"Now I want to show you where my bees
live," said Gretel. And she led the boys up
the hill behind her house where, under some
great trees, was a row of tiny chalets.</p>

<p>"This is my bee village," she said. "Each
bee family has a little chalet of its own. The
bees fly all over our alp, gathering nectar from
the flowers. Sometimes they fly very far away,
hunting for more flowers, but they always come
back again, bringing their baskets full of nectar.</p>

<p>"They work so hard, they fill their little
houses brim full of honey every summer. I am
sure we couldn't live without our bees. Some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
summers they earn more money than father
can."</p>

<p>"There must be millions of bees in Switzerland
to make so much honey," said Jack. "I
believe every family here eats honey for breakfast.
In America we eat cereal. I think honey
is much nicer."</p>

<h2>ON THE TRAIL</h2>


<p>"Come, boys!" called their father. "It is
time to go on. Gretel's mother says she may
go with us as far as her father's cabin. We
shall give Franz and Sep a fine surprise."</p>

<p>"Oh, goody!" cried Gretel. "I haven't
seen Franz and Sep since they took the cows
up the mountain in the spring."</p>

<p>"Tell us about it, Gretel," said Jack.
"What happens when the cows go up the
mountain?"</p>

<p>"Why, that is the jolliest day of the whole
year," said Gretel, "except, perhaps, the day
when they all come home in the fall.</p>

<p>"Father ties big bells around the necks of
the prettiest cows, and mother and I trim
their horns with flowers. Then the procession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
begins. This year Sep led the procession with
his seven little goats. He was the proudest
boy that ever went up the mountain.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 568px;">
<img src="images/i-080.jpg" width="568" height="360" alt="following goats" />
<div class="caption"><i>Sep led the procession with his seven little goats</i></div>
</div>

<p>"The cows know what it means when the
bells are tied to their necks. The summer on
the alps is a long picnic for them. Mother and
I go up a little way with the procession. Other
families take their cows up the mountain the
same day, and we sing and have a jolly time."</p>

<p>"Do you send all of your cows up to
the higher alps in the spring?" asked Jack.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
"Where did you get the delicious cream that
your mother gave us to-day?"</p>

<p>"We keep one cow at home to give us milk
and cream during the summer," said Gretel.
"I am always sorry for the poor cow that is
left behind, she is so lonesome. We have to
tie her very carefully, or she runs away. She
keeps going until she finds her friends 'way
up the mountain. Then, of course, father or
one of the boys must bring her down again."</p>

<p>"Oh, Gretel, when your brothers see you
coming they will think you have run away
because you are so lonesome without them,"
said Joe, laughing.</p>

<p>"Well, they must keep me a week before
they take me home, or I shall run away
again," said Gretel. "I <i>am</i> lonesome without
them."</p>

<p>And so they talked, as they tramped along
together up the mountain trail. Once they met
a man with a large milk can on his back. The
man greeted the party with a friendly, "Guten
Tag! Gl&uuml;ckliche Reise!" This was his way of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
saying, "Good day! A happy journey!" So
the boys quickly answered, "Danke sch&ouml;n!"
which means, "Thank you kindly!"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 581px;">
<img src="images/i-081.jpg" width="581" height="365" alt="wating for man with milk can to pass" />
<div class="caption"><i>Once they met a man with a large milk can on his back</i></div>
</div>

<p>Every day this man carried his can full of
milk down the mountain to sell to the people
who had no cows. He always greeted the
strangers whom he passed on the way, and
wished them a happy journey.</p>

<p>On and on, and up and up the little party
tramped. At last they began to see snowbanks,
in shaded places near the trail. Sometimes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
just below a large snowbank, they
found a sunny spot covered with a carpet of
lovely summer flowers. There were violets
and buttercups and daisies and forget-me-nots,
and low bushes of small red alpine roses.</p>

<p>These little wild gardens were watered all
summer by the melting snows. The gay flowers
seemed to like the icy water at their roots.</p>

<p>The Overall Boys often stopped for a snowball
battle with each other and with Gretel.
Then from some mountain garden, they picked
fresh flowers for their hats, and on they tramped.</p>

<p>Their trail led them below a large glacier,
which lay between two high mountain peaks
not far away. The boys could hear the great
ice river twisting and turning in its bed, for
the hot summer sun made it very uncomfortable.</p>

<p>Once there came a loud boom, like a cannon.
The boom was followed by a crash, and
the crash by a long, loud rumbling noise, which
gradually died away.</p>

<p>"Oh, Gretel, what was that?" cried Joe. "I
believe it was an earthquake."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 589px;">
<img src="images/i-082.jpg" width="589" height="378" alt="Mountain in background" />
<div class="caption"><i>One of the mountain alps they crossed</i></div>
</div>

<p>"Oh, no! That was not an earthquake,"
said Gretel, laughing. "That was a piece of the
glacier breaking off. It must have had a long
fall before it found a place where it could stop."</p>

<p>"I am glad it couldn't fall in this direction,"
said Jack. "I thought I wanted to take a
walk on a glacier, but I am not so sure about
it now."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, you must!" said Gretel. "It is
lots of fun. I have been up to that glacier
twice with father. There are great cracks in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
it, so deep you can hardly see the bottom of
them. It is perfectly safe to go with father.
He often takes Americans up there."</p>

<p>"Well, I think I should rather take a walk
on some other glacier. I am afraid this one
is going to pieces," said Joe.</p>

<p>"No, it isn't!" said Gretel, laughing at Joe
again. "The glacier melts and moves a little
every summer, but a great deal of fresh snow
falls on it every winter. I guess it will last
as long as the mountains do."</p>

<h2>THE HERDSMAN'S CABIN</h2>


<p>It was late afternoon before the trampers
reached the green alp where Gretel's father and
brothers were pasturing their cows.</p>

<p>It was milking time. Franz and his father
were milking the big, brown cows near the
cabin. Sep was milking his goats. The pigs
were eating their supper of skimmed milk, and
Barry, the dog, was keeping his eye on them all.</p>

<p>It was Barry who first saw the trampers,
and away he bounded to meet them. His bark
was very fierce until Gretel called him by
name, then he almost wagged his tail off, he
was so glad to see her. He was even glad to
see the strangers, because they had brought
Gretel with them.</p>

<p>Franz and Sep and their father were just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
as happy as Barry to see their little Gretel
and her strange friends from America.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 583px;">
<img src="images/i-086.jpg" width="583" height="407" alt="milking cows" />
<div class="caption"><i>It was milking time, and Franz and his father were milking the big, brown cows near the cabin</i></div>
</div>

<p>Soon they were all eating supper together,
sitting around a rough table in the small cabin.
It was a simple supper, but the hungry boys
thought they never had eaten a nicer one.
There was a long loaf of bread, and a great
round cheese with holes all through it, and a dish
of wild strawberries, and a pitcher of warm milk.</p>

<p>While they were eating, they suddenly heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
the clear, sweet notes of a horn. The sound
came from the high mountain above the cabin.
In a moment the same notes came more softly
from the mountain on the other side of the alp,
and again still more softly they came.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 379px;">
<img src="images/i-087.jpg" width="379" height="248" alt="herdsman blowing horn" />
<div class="caption"><i>Then the herdsman took his great horn, which was taller than himself, and blew a few long, clear notes on it in answer</i></div>
</div>

<p>"What is that?" cried Joe.</p>

<p>"It is my neighbor, who pastures his cows
on the alp above us," said Gretel's father.
"He is blowing his great horn to tell us that
the sun is just setting behind that snow-covered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
peak. I must answer him, so he may know
that all is well with us."</p>

<p>Then the herdsman took his great horn, which
was taller than himself, and went out in front
of his cabin. He blew a few long, clear notes,
which meant, he said, "Praise ye the Lord."
Again and again the same notes came back
in echo from the mountain walls, each time
more softly.</p>

<p>The snow-covered peaks were no longer white,
but glowing red from the rays of the setting
sun. Then darkness came on very quickly.</p>

<p>The tired travelers were glad to find a small
inn on the alp where they could spend the
night. Of course Gretel stayed with her father
and brothers in their little cabin.</p>

<p>There were only two rooms in the cabin.
The larger room belonged to the cows. They
came in here to be milked in stormy weather.
In the other room the family cooked and ate
and made their cheeses. Their bedroom was a
low balcony over one end of this room, and
they reached it by climbing up a short ladder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 573px;">
<img src="images/i-088.jpg" width="573" height="381" alt="with Sep and his goats" />
<div class="caption"><i>Early the next morning Jack and Joe went with Sep and his goats up the rocky mountain side</i></div>
</div>

<p>Next morning the boys were wakened early
by Sep calling to them outside of their window.</p>

<p>"Oh, Jack and Joe," he called, "come with
me. I have to take my goats up the mountain
to their pasture. There is something fine up
there that I want to show you."</p>

<p>So Jack and Joe went with Sep and his
goats up the rocky mountain side. It was a
hard climb, but it was fun.</p>

<p>The little goats could climb anywhere. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
went into dangerous places where the cows could
not go, and they found many tender bits of grass
to eat.</p>

<p>When the boys had climbed very high, Sep
crept carefully out on a narrow shelf of rock.
He lay face downward and reached far over
the edge. The mountain side was very steep
below him.</p>

<p>"Watch me, boys!" he cried. "But don't
you come too near."</p>

<p>Then, very carefully, he picked a small, furry,
white flower which was growing on the steep,
rocky wall. He picked another and another of
the flowers, until his hand was full of them.</p>

<p>"There now!" he cried. "You know my
secret. I have shown you where my edelweiss
grows. It grows only in the most dangerous
places on the high mountains. I pick a few of
the flowers every day, when they are in bloom, to
sell to travelers who cross our alp, but you are
the only people I have ever brought up here to
see them growing."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 248px;">
<img src="images/i-089.jpg" width="248" height="407" alt="flowers" />
<div class="caption"><i>Edelweiss</i></div>
</div>
<p>"Oh, thank you, Sep!" cried Jack. "We'll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
never, never tell your secret. But please let
us pick a few of the flowers ourselves."</p>

<p>So each of the boys carried down the mountain
a handful of the proud
little flowers which they
had picked themselves.</p>


<p>The Overall Boys
were real mountain climbers
at last, for only mountain
climbers ever find
and pick the edelweiss.</p>

<p>When the boys reached
the cabin, Sep's father was
watching a great kettle
of milk, over an open fire.
He had put more than a
hundred quarts of milk
into the copper kettle, with a little rennet to
make it turn into curd.</p>

<p>Herdsmen make their rennet by soaking a
calf's stomach in water or in whey; they then
save this liquid to use in making their cheeses.</p>

<p>Sep's father stirred and watched the milk in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
his great copper kettle until the curd began to
form. He then swung the kettle away from
the fire, and put both bare arms into the warm
milk. He worked the cheese into one large
lump, and lifted it out on a great tray, where
he worked it still more to squeeze out the milk.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 584px;">
<img src="images/i-090.jpg" width="584" height="415" alt="Inside a dairy" />
<div class="caption"><i>Sep's father stirred and watched the milk in his great copper kettle until the curd began to form</i></div>
</div>

<p>It was then put into a round, wooden
press a few days. Each day the press was
opened and the cheese rubbed with salt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>When it was just right, it would be taken
out and laid on a shelf in the small cheese
house, where all the cheeses were kept until
they could be carried down the mountain and
sold. But they were not really good to eat
until they were at least six months old.</p>

<p>Sep's father made one of these cheeses every
day, and he made cheeses from his goats' milk,
too. He and his boys lived a busy life on the
mountain. They had no time to be lonesome.</p>

<p>The Overall Boys told Franz and Sep how
they often had Swiss cheese for dinner in
America. They said when they got home again
they should certainly tell their grocer just how
his big Swiss cheeses were made.</p>

<h2>A SUMMER BLIZZARD</h2>


<p>The travelers spent two happy days with
their friends in the herdsman's cabin. They
would like to have spent the rest of the summer
with them. Jack and Joe would like to have
learned how to milk the goats and how to blow
the great alpine horn.</p>

<p>But there were many other things which
they wanted to do and to see in this wonderful
little country of Switzerland, so they
shouldered their knapsacks and started once
more on the trail.</p>

<p>The way soon became steep and rocky.
Gray clouds hid the snow-covered peaks. The
wind blew cold, and the boys were glad of the
hard climb to keep themselves warm.</p>

<p>They crossed one or two small alps where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
cows were feeding, and they stopped at a tiny
cabin to ask for a drink of milk.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 571px;">
<img src="images/i-094.jpg" width="571" height="380" alt="three boys and a kettle" />
<div class="caption"><i>In the cabin they found a small boy watching a large kettle of milk over an open fire</i></div>
</div>

<p>In the cabin they found a small boy, who was
watching a large kettle of milk over an open
fire. The boy said that his father had gone up
the mountain to hunt for a lost cow, so he
was making cheese from his goats' milk.</p>

<p>The Overall Boys were quite sure that they
would be lonesome, if they had to stay away
up there all alone. But this little boy whistled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
and sang and talked with his goats, calling
them each by name. They really were having
a jolly time together.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 599px;">
<img src="images/i-095.jpg" width="599" height="415" alt="three boys and some goats" />
<div class="caption"><i>The boy and the goats had jolly times together</i></div>
</div>

<p>After the good drink of milk the travelers
tramped on and up, while the gray clouds
dropped lower and the wind grew colder. Soon
fine white flakes began to frisk through the
air and to dance on the boys' cheeks.</p>

<p>"Oh, Jack," called Joe, "it is snowing!"</p>

<p>"So it is!" shouted Jack. "It's snowing! It's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
really snowing, and it's summer time! Hurrah!"</p>

<p>The white flakes fell faster and thicker. In
a few moments they were falling so fast and
so thick the trampers could see only a short
way ahead of them. It was hard climbing now.
The path was steep and slippery. The boys had
to stop often to get their breath, and their
knapsacks suddenly grew very heavy.</p>

<p>"I suppose it is because we are up so high,"
said Jack. "The air is so thin up here we
can't get enough of it to breathe. It is always
like that on the high mountains, they say."</p>

<p>"I don't care," said Joe. "We are in a
snow blizzard, anyhow. Just think of it!"</p>

<p>"I shouldn't care to lose our path," said Jack.
"I guess it wouldn't be a very happy night for
us if we did."</p>

<p>"Oh, Jack, I have lost the path already! I can
hardly see you. My! How it snows! Where
are father and mother?"</p>

<p>"Here we are!" shouted their father. "I think
we are near the top of the Pass. I hear a dog
barking. There is a house up at the top, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
we can stay all night. Keep climbing, boys!"</p>

<p>Just then a great dog came bounding down the
mountain toward them. He gave a short, quick
bark, turned about and led the party safely up to
the small hotel. Then away he bounded again to
find other travelers, who might be lost in the snow
and who needed his help. He was a St. Bernard
dog, and he had saved the lives of many people
on the high mountains.</p>

<p>It was a tired party that spent the night in
the little hotel at the top of the Great Scheidegg
Pass, but when morning came they were ready
for another battle with the snow.</p>

<p>Of course the trail was covered, and the snow
was too soft and too deep for them to tramp over
it without snowshoes. The little party was snow-bound
on the mountains in midsummer.</p>

<p>But the Overall Boys liked being snow-bound.
They built a fine snow fort, with snow soldiers
in it, and piles of snow cannon balls to keep
enemies away from the little hotel.</p>

<p>The St. Bernard dog had a jolly time, too.
Once he jumped against one of the snow soldiers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
and over they went together. After that he
seemed to be afraid of the soldiers and would not
go near the fort, but ran around it, barking
loudly.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 565px;">
<img src="images/i-096.jpg" width="565" height="357" alt="the boys and dog building little  snowmen" />
<div class="caption"><i>The Overall Boys and the dog enjoying the snow</i></div>
</div>

<p>Next morning the boys were out early to
take a look at things.</p>

<p>"Oh, Jack," shouted Joe, "it froze in the
night! There is a hard crust over everything!"</p>

<p>"So there is!" said Jack. "We don't need
snowshoes now. We can go down the mountain
on the crust."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>And that is what they did. With the St.
Bernard dog to show them the way, the party
hurried down over the snow before the warm
sun had time to soften the crust.</p>

<p>As they went lower, the snow rapidly grew
less. Soon the boys saw lovely bluebells and
alpine roses and other flowers holding their
heads bravely up through the thin, white blanket.</p>

<p>A few moments later their own trail came in
sight. It was no longer hidden by the snow.
The St. Bernard dog gave a loud bark, wagged
his tail, and bounded back up the mountain.
His work for that party was done.</p>

<h2>EXPLORING A GLACIER</h2>


<p>The rest of the way down the mountain
was easy tramping.</p>

<p>The path soon led by the end of the great
Upper Wetterhorn Glacier, and the Overall
Boys begged their father to let them explore it.</p>

<p>"All right," said their father. "Just step
into this small car and we will go on an
exploring trip."</p>

<p>Before the boys knew what was happening,
the tiny square car rose from the ground and
began moving slowly upward, following the
steep slope of the mountain.</p>

<p>"Oh, Jack, where are we going?" cried Joe.
"This car is built bottom side up. The wheels
are on the top of it, instead of on the bottom."</p>

<p>"That's so!" exclaimed Jack. "We are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
hanging in the air on a cable. It is lifting us
right up the mountain side. And look away
up there! Another car just like this one is
coming down. My! Do you suppose we shall
go as high as that?"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 571px;">
<img src="images/i-100.jpg" width="571" height="376" alt="riding an aerial tram" />
<div class="caption"><i>"We are hanging in the air on a cable," Jack exclaimed. "It is lifting us right up the mountain side"</i></div>
</div>

<p>"I hope so," said Joe. "But see what is
below us. It is the glacier! Look at the
great cracks in it. Do you hear that noise,
Jack? It sounds like thunder."</p>

<p>"I guess it is only another crack bursting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
open," said Jack. "This hot sun makes the
glacier move faster, and so it cracks open."</p>

<p>Up, up, climbed the car, right over the
glacier, until it came to a wild goat's path on
a narrow shelf of the mountain, more than
twelve hundred feet above the starting point.</p>

<p>Here it slipped into a small station, and
everybody stepped out. Other people took their
places, and then the car moved slowly downward,
leaving the boys on the steep mountain side.</p>

<p>"My! That was great!" cried Jack. "Now
what are we going to do?"</p>

<p>"We are going to walk across the glacier,
aren't we, father?" said Joe.</p>

<p>"Of course we are. We have come up here
to explore it, you know," said their father.</p>

<p>And they did explore 'way across the great
ice river. In many places they had to walk
very carefully, or they would have fallen into
one of the deep cracks, but at last they came
safely to the other side. There was no car on
this side of the glacier to carry them down the
mountain, but there were long ladders to help<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
them over the very hardest and steepest places.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 574px;">
<img src="images/i-101.jpg" width="574" height="384" alt="boys climbing a ladder up the side of a crevasse" />
<div class="caption"><i>There was no car on this side of the glacier, but there were long ladders to help them over the steepest places</i></div>
</div>

<p>They had to climb over great ridges of rocks,
which the glacier had torn away from the higher
mountains years and years before. These rocks
had been brought slowly down on the ice, and
dropped along the sides and end of the glacier.</p>

<p>At last the party came to the place where
the sun and the warm winds changed the glacier
from a river of ice to a river of water.</p>

<p>"Well, boys," said their father, "we have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
had a look at the outside of the glacier; now let
us take a look at the inside of it." So a man
threw warm blankets over their shoulders, and
they entered a long, narrow passage through a
hole in the ice wall.</p>

<p>This passage led into a beautiful, blue ice
room. The floor was ice, the walls were ice,
and the ceiling was ice. There was no lamp in
the room, and yet it was not dark.</p>

<p>"Isn't it beautiful!" cried Joe. "Think of it,
we are in the center of a great ice river. There
is nothing but ice all around us."</p>

<p>"I know it," said Jack. "I am sure the
glaciers are the most wonderful things in Switzerland,
but I have stayed inside of this one as long
as I want to. I should rather be tramping."</p>

<h2>AUF WIEDERSEHEN</h2>


<p>And so they tramped on. They spent several
days in the lovely village of Grindelwald. They
explored glaciers. They saw waterfalls nearly
a thousand feet high. They played games with
the village boys and girls.</p>

<p>They even went almost to the top of the
great Jungfrau mountain, over its wonderful
railroad. The highest part of this railroad is
built through a tunnel, for the surface of the
mountain is covered always with snow and ice.</p>

<p>The train carried them nearly twelve thousand
feet above the ocean. They were twice as high up
as they were on the top of Mount Rigi. There
were miles and miles of snow and ice all
around them, and great banks of snow-white
clouds in the blue sky close above.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<div class="caption"><i>They had glimpses into deep, narrow valleys</i></div>
</div>

<p>They could see many high peaks covered
with snow fields and glaciers, and lower
mountains covered with green forests and
alpine pastures. They had glimpses into deep,
narrow valleys with muddy rivers rushing
through them. Here and there were big, broad
valleys dotted with villages and farms, and
beautiful blue lakes, while the busy railroad
trains looked like worms creeping over the hills
and down the valleys. It was a wonderful view.</p>

<p>The Overall Boys learned more about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
geography of Switzerland in a few minutes
from this high mountain than they had learned
during all the days of travel lower down. They
never will forget what they saw while there.</p>

<p>But the vacation days were over at last.
The boys had visited only a small part of the
wonderful little country, but they had seen
enough of it to make them want to spend another
summer vacation in just the same way. They
are sure that Switzerland is the very finest playground
in the whole world, and a great many
other people think so, too.</p>

<p>As the train hurried them far away from the
high, snow-covered mountains, the boys stood by
the car windows, watching and enjoying everything.</p>

<p>They passed ripe grain fields, in which wild
scarlet poppies and tall bluebells were growing.</p>

<p>Close by these wild-flower gardens there was
often a row of tiny chalets, where swarms of
bees lived and made their delicious honey.</p>

<p>The train passed also through many villages
of larger chalets, with broad red roofs and vine-covered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
balconies. In front of these pretty
homes sat women and little girls working at
their lace and fine embroidery.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 580px;">
<img src="images/i-106.jpg" width="580" height="385" alt="more hikers" />
<div class="caption"><i>They saw boys with goatskin book sacks on their backs</i></div>
</div>

<p>Now and then they saw groups of small boys
carrying goatskin book sacks on their backs, for
the short summer vacation was over, and the
Swiss schools had begun.</p>

<p>In a flower garden, near one of the stations,
a mountain dwarf waved a Swiss flag in farewell
to the passing travelers. But the nicest good-by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
came from a row of boys and girls sitting on
a fence near the railroad track. They were
selling wild flowers to travelers, as the trains
stopped at their station. They shouted the
names in German, French, and English&mdash;"Alpine
roses, primroses, edelweiss, daisies, buttercups!"&mdash;and
they eagerly begged the travelers to buy.</p>

<p>Of course Jack and Joe bought their hands
full, for these might be the last Swiss flowers they
would have for a very long time.</p>

<p>As the train moved on, the boys and girls, sitting
on the fence, waved their hands and shouted,
"Auf Wiedersehen! Gl&uuml;ckliche Reise!"</p>

<p>And the Overall Boys shouted back, "Good-by!
Good-by, until we meet again!"</p>

<h2>A LETTER</h2>


<p><i>Dear Boys and Girls:</i></p>

<p><i>I expect you will agree with the Overall Boys
that nowhere else can there be quite so many wonderful
things to see and to do, as there are in
Switzerland.</i></p>

<p><i>Massachusetts and New Hampshire are very
small states, you know, but together they are larger
than the whole of Switzerland, and more people live
in these two small states than live in Switzerland
to-day.</i></p>

<p><i>One fourth of this famous little country is
covered with lakes and rivers and glaciers, and
nearly another fourth with great forests, while a
large part of the remaining land is used as pasturage
for a million and a half cows.</i></p>

<p><i>Raising cows and making cheese is the principal
industry, but the clever Swiss people have many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
other prosperous industries as well. They make
fine silks and ribbons and marvelous little watches
and music boxes and jewelry and delicious sweet
chocolate. Some of the men do fine wood carving,
and the women do beautiful embroidery.</i></p>

<p><i>One of the most important lines of work is
hotel keeping. Many thousands of strangers visit
Switzerland every year. In winter they go there
for the skating and sleighing and snowshoeing and
skiing and to enjoy the bracing mountain air. In
summer they do what the Overall Boys did, besides
many other interesting things.</i></p>

<p><i>Travelers spend so much money in Switzerland,
and the people who live there work so hard, they
have become the richest people in the world.</i></p>

<p><i>Swiss schools are especially fine. Children are
obliged to attend school from the time they are six
years old until they are fifteen or sixteen years old.</i></p>

<p><i>In summer the schools begin at seven o'clock in
the morning and in winter at eight o'clock, holding
four hours. During the winter months there is also
a session of three hours each afternoon in the week,
excepting two. On these two afternoons the boys
are given other work to do, and the girls attend
sewing classes. They have no regular holiday, but
must go to school six days every week. The boys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
do a great deal of gymnasium work in the winter,
which keeps them strong and trains them to be
mountain guides and hunters and herdsmen.</i></p>

<p><i>There are three national languages in Switzerland&mdash;German
and French and Italian. German
is used much more than French or Italian, but
nearly all Swiss boys and girls learn to speak at
least two languages. Sometimes they learn three
or four. In fact it is said that Swiss people learn
to speak languages more perfectly than any other
people in the world. They are certainly among the
best educated and most courageous people in the
world.</i></p>

<p><i>The Overall Boys learned a great deal while
traveling in that beautiful little country, and they
are glad to share it all with you.</i></p>

<div class='sig'>
